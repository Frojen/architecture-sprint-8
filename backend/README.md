# FastAPI Project - Reports microservice

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

## General Workflow

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From `./backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```console
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your editor is using the correct Python virtual environment, with the interpreter at `backend/.venv/bin/python`.

Modify or add API endpoints in `./backend/app/api/`.

```console
$ docker compose exec backend bash
```
